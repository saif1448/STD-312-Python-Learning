Set and its properties
	1. Values of set cannot be changed
	2. items can be added or deleted into sets
	3. Most functions of tuples and list can be used
		1. sorted()
		2. min(), max(), sum()
	4. items don't have fixed order, so no indexing
	5. Common Functions of Set:
		1. Insertion
			1. add()
		2. Deletion
			1. remove(elem) ---> if not found raise error
			2. discard(elem) ---> remove element if found, if not found no error is being raised
			3. pop() ---> removes and return a random element
			4. clear() ---> removes everything in the set
		3. Searching
			1. in operator
		4. Sorting
			1. sorted() ---> set doesnt have order, it returns a sorted list in ascending order by default (it is not called via object)
			2.
		5. Traversing
			1. use for loop
		6. Merging
			1. Can be done using *set operations
	6. Set Operations
		1. Union
			1. a.union()
			2. '|' this operator does the same
		2. Intersection
			1. a.intersection(b)
			2. '&' this operator does the same
		3. Difference
			1. a.difference(b)
			2. '-' this operator does the same
		4. Symmetric Difference
			1. a.symmetric_difference(b)
	7. Set Comparsion
