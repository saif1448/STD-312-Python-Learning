The data structures here in python can be called as Collections also

Collections means they can contain data

List, Tuple ----> Ordered ----> you can index them
----> They are sequential data structure
----> String, Range()

The basic common things for the sequential data structures are

1. Indexing
2. Slicing
3. Repetition, eg, "abc"*3 => "abcabcabc"
4. Length: such as len([1,2,3,4,5]) => 5
5. Membership: in operation and not in operator
6. Iterable: as in the for loop

    for var in iterable:
        pass


Dictionary and Set ----> They are not sequential
1. You cannot index them in sequential
2. You cannot slice
3. You cannot repeat them
4. You can see the length
5. There are many member functions
6. We cannot use the in operator and looping

{
    'key 1': 'value 1',
    'key 2': 'value 2',
    'key 3': 'value 3'
}
