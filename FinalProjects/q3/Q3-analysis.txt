Question 3 Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis
=========================================

Strengths:
The Question 3 implementation excellently extends the student management system with sophisticated data analysis and
visualization features. The statistical analysis is particularly well-implemented, using numpy for accurate calculation
of top and bottom 10% performers, with proper handling of percentile calculations and ties at cutoff points.
The visualization components are professionally implemented using matplotlib, featuring both bar charts for mark
distribution and pie charts for grade distribution, complete with proper formatting, clear titles, and informative
labels. The code maintains all the robust features from Q2 including file handling and data management
while seamlessly integrating the new analytical capabilities. The implementation demonstrates good separation of
concerns, keeping visualization logic separate from data management, and includes well-documented functions explaining
 the statistical methodologies used. The user interface is enhanced with new options for viewing different types of
 analyses and visualizations, making the statistical information easily accessible.

Weaknesses:
Despite its advanced features, the implementation has several areas that could be enhanced for better functionality and
 user experience. The visualization system uses basic matplotlib implementations, lacking interactive features that
 could make the data exploration more dynamic and engaging. The current implementation doesn't provide options to export
 the generated charts or save analysis results for future
 reference. The visualization styling is fixed, offering no customization options for users who might need different
 representations or color schemes.
