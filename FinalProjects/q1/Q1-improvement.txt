Question 1 Code Review and Improvements
=====================================

Strengths
---------
1. Error Handling
   * Proper try-except blocks for input validation
   * ValueError handling for invalid inputs
   * Range validation for student number and unit marks

2. Code Organization
   * Well-segregated functions by responsibility
   * Clear main program loop
   * Consistent naming conventions

Weaknesses and Potential Improvements
----------------------------------
1. Data Persistence
   Current: Uses in-memory list (data lost on program exit)
   Improvements:
   * Implement file storage (JSON/CSV)
   * Use SQLite database
   * Add data export/import features

2. Input Validation
   Current: Basic numeric validation only
   Improvements:
   * Add name validation (empty strings, special characters)

3. Error Handling Gaps
   * No handling when student not found in remove operation
   * Missing validation for grade input in show_grade_search_student

Technical Alternative Approaches
-----------------------------
Instead of using python dictionary, if object oriented programming was used, it could handle the student data more efficiently.
