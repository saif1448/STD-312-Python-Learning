Question 2 Code Review and Improvements
=====================================

Strengths
---------
1. File Operations
   * Handles file existence checks
   * Multiple options for file saving (overwrite/rename/cancel)
   * Proper file closing using 'with' statements

2. Enhanced Features from Q1
   * Added data persistence through CSV files
   * Implemented student record modification
   * Added duplicate student ID checking
   * Added comprehensive file save options

3. Error Handling
   * FileNotFoundError handling for missing input files
   * Duplicate student number checking

4. Code Organization
   * Clear separation of concerns (file I/O, data manipulation)
   * Consistent function naming and structure

Weaknesses and Potential Improvements
----------------------------------
1. File Path Handling
   * File path only works for current directory. Other than current file directory, it cannot find the file

Technical Alternative Approaches
-----------------------------
1. Object-Oriented Implementation

Recommended Improvements for Implementation
----------------------------------------
1. Immediate Enhancements
   * Add proper path handling using pathlib
   * Implement proper error messages
