Question 2 Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis
=========================================

Strengths:
The Question 2 implementation significantly enhances the basic student management system by introducing robust file
operations and data persistence. The code demonstrates excellent file handling with proper CSV operations, including
careful management of file existence checks and UTF-8 encoding. The implementation successfully builds upon Q1 by
adding crucial features such as data persistence through CSV files, student record modification capabilities, and
duplicate student ID checking. The file saving system is particularly well-designed, offering users multiple options
(overwrite/rename/cancel) when dealing with existing files. Error handling is enhanced to include FileNotFoundError
 handling and duplicate record checking, making the system more robust. The code maintains good separation of
 concerns between file I/O and data manipulation operations, with consistent function naming and clear structure, making
  it maintainable and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
Despite its improvements, the implementation has several limitations that could affect its robustness and usability.
The file path handling is restricted to the current directory, limiting the system's flexibility in accessing files from
different locations. The code still relies on a basic data structure approach rather than leveraging object-oriented
 programming principles, which could provide better organization and encapsulation. Error handling, while improved,
 could be more comprehensive, particularly in validating CSV file structure and handling file permission errors.
 Input validation remains basic, particularly for string inputs like student names and file paths. The implementation
 could benefit from better progress indicators during file operations and more informative error messages.
